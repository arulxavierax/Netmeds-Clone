            assist us in order to facilitate the provision of services and

            consent to any such disclosure of your information with third party

            Information. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such
            transfer if the new entity's planned processing of your information

            transacted through secure digital platforms of approved payment
            gateways, which are under encryption, thereby complying with
            reasonably expected technology standards. The verification of the
            Financial Information shall be accomplished only by you through a
            process of authentication in which we shall have no role to play and
            hence, we shall bear no liability in relation to the same. We shall
            neither be liable nor responsible for any actions or inactions of
            the third party payment gateway providers or any breach of
            conditions, representations and warranties given by them. We shall
            also not be obligated to mediate or resolve any dispute or
            disagreement between you and such third party payment service
            providers.
          </p>

            4.5 While we make best efforts to ensure that your information
            including Personal Information, Financial Information and Sensitive
            Personal Information or Data is duly protected by undertaking

            advised to exercise reasonable discretion while providing Personal
            Information or Financial Information while using the services given
            that the Internet is susceptible to security breaches

            Privacy Policy, we reserve the right to transfer your information
            outside of your country. By using the (Platform, you consent to such
            transfer of your information outside of your country and also within

            subcontractors, provided they have agreed to ensure the same level
            of data protection as prescribed under this Privacy Policy and the
            data protection laws of India. The information may be transferred in
            the event it is necessary for the performance of the services,
            operation of the Platform and provision of Products as agreed upon
            between us and the third party.
